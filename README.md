# 2048 Clone

This is my rendition of the game 2048, originally created by Gabrielle Cirulli in 2014. I used to indulge in this game frequently in the past, but it slipped from my mind as time passed. However, in early 2024, a friend of mine mentioned the he was back playing the game, reigniting my interest and prompting me to play it once more. Upon revisiting the original source code on GitHub, I felt inspired to embark on building my own version. 

This project is solely for personal purposes, aimed at gaining more hands-on coding experience.
