# 2048

This is my rendition of the game 2048, originally created by Gabrielle Cirulli in 2014. 

# To do

- Animations
- Different colors for different numbers
- Clean board after game over
- Unit tests
- Component tests
- Backend: creating users, logging in, top-10 scores?

# Bugs

- Should calculate only two numbers next to each other on one swipe, now calculates all the numbers on the row/column
